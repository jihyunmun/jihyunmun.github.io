My name is Jihyun Mun.  
I am currently pursuing an integrated M.A.–Ph.D. in Linguistics at Seoul National University, where I work in the Spoken Language Processing Lab.  
Prior to this, I completed a B.A. in Mechanical Engineering and a double major in Linguistics, also at Seoul National University.

I am actively seeking a postdoctoral position. Please feel free to contact me!

My research centers on **atypical speech—spoken language produced by individuals with disabilities or disorders**. 
I conduct acoustic and linguistic analyses of such speech to better understand its characteristics, and I develop models for the automatic detection and severity estimation of the underlying conditions. 
To ensure clinical relevance and practical utility, I place strong emphasis on model interpretability and the creation of reliable, non-invasive, and accessible tools for auxiliary diagnosis and screening.
A key component of this work also involves designing speech recognition systems that are tailored specifically to atypical speech.

I envision a more inclusive world—one in which everyone can communicate comfortably—and aspire to build speech technologies that truly benefit people in equitable and inclusive ways.
