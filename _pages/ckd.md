## Construction of a Cohort through Voice Banking of Chronic Kidney Disease Patients and Analysis of Voice Characteristics according to Renal Function
- **Funding Source**: Seoul National University Bundang Hospital  
- **Period**: 2022.03 - 2024.02  
- **Role**: Corpus design, acoustic analysis, automatic detection and severity assessment model development
- 

### Summary

This project aimed to investigate the acoustic characteristics of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) to support the development of non-invasive, accessible, and speech-based tools for auxiliary diagnosis and screening.
It was conducted in collaboration with Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, led by Prof. Sejoong Kim and Prof. Jiwon Ryu.
Key research outcomes include:
- Development of the first speech corpus for CKD
- Acoustic analysis and characterization of CKD-related speech patterns
- Machine learning and deep learning models for automatic CKD detection and severity estimation
