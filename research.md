## Research Areas

My research focuses on atypical speechâ€”spoken language produced by individuals with disorders, diseases, or disabilities. I approach this domain from multiple, yet closely connected, perspectives:

---

### 1. Acoustic and Linguistic Analysis of Atypical Speech

I investigate the speech characteristics of individuals with various medical or developmental conditions, including neurodevelopmental disorders, neurological impairments, and chronic diseases.  
These analyses aim to uncover reliable acoustic and linguistic markers that differentiate atypical from typical speech and capture intra-speaker and inter-speaker variability.

---

### 2. Development of Clinically Reliable and Interpretable Diagnostic Tools

Building upon these analyses, I develop auxiliary diagnostic and screening tools that are:
- **Non-invasive** and **speech-based**
- **Clinically interpretable** for practical use by healthcare professionals
- Grounded in **machine learning and deep learning**, with an emphasis on model transparency

### 3. Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for Atypical Speech

I design and fine-tune ASR systems specifically tailored to atypical speech, which poses unique challenges due to acoustic irregularities and linguistic variability.  
This work contributes to the development of inclusive technologies that can support communication and clinical applications for underrepresented speaker populations.

Ultimately, I aim to build speech technologies that are not only accurate but also inclusive, interpretable, and impactful in real-world healthcare and assistive settings.
